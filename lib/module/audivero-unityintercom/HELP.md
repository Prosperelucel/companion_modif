## Audivero Unity Intercom

This module will allow you to monitor the logged in status of users in Unity Intercom with feedback on a button.

### Configuration
* Enter the IP address of the Unity Intercom server.
* The device will by default use HTTP port 20101, or you can change it.

**Available options:**
* Assign feedback status to a button to see if any user is logged in or out
* This is currently a feedback-only module. There are no action options, as Unity Intercom does not have any action-related API's available.
