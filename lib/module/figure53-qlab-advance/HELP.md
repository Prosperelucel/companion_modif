# Help for the QLabFB module

What does QLab do?
QLab makes it simple to create intricate designs of light, sound, and video, which you play back during a live performance.
QLab allows you to lock in exactly how you want the light, sound, and video to play during your performance. When you’re done designing, you'll switch to “show mode” and run your show just by pressing “GO”.

Go over to [figure 53](https://figure53.com/) and checkout the software.

This module adds a TCP mode option to the *QLab* module.
Due to the nature and volume of information feedback and variables are only available in TCP mode.
This may cause a noticible increase in network traffic.

This module was tested against QLab4. Nothing specific to QLab4 is used, so QLab3 should work, too.

## Configuration
* **Target IP** Enter the address of the QLab computer. You can enter 127.0.0.1 if Companion is running on the same computer.
* **Use TCP?** Check to enable TCP mode. This is required for variables and feedback.
* **Use Tenths** If checked, the variable *r_left* will display 0.1 seconds when less than 5 seconds. If unchecked, the time left will be adjusted by 1 second for a more accurate count-down.
* **OSC Passcode** Enter a passcode if needed for the QLab workspace.
* **Workspace** Enter the workspace title or ID to control a specific QLab workspace.

## Actions

The following actions are available:
* **Go:** Tell the current cue list of the given workspace to GO.
* **Pause:** Pause all currently running cues in the workspace.
* **Resume:** Un-pause all paused cues in the workspace.
* **Stop:** Stop playback but allow effects to continue rendering. e.g., playback stops, but reverbs decay naturally.
* **Panic:** Tell the workspace to panic. A panic is a brief gradual fade out leading into a hard stop. A double panic will trigger an immediate hard stop.
* **Reset:** Reset the workspace. Resetting stops all cues, returns the playhead to the top of the current cue list, and restores any temporary changes made to cues (such as retargeting via a Target cue or adjustments using a "live" OSC method.)
* **Next:** Move the selection down one cue.
* **Previous:** Move the selection up one cue.
* **GoTo (cue):** Move the playhead to (cue). Doesn't start the cue.
* **Start (cue):** Start (cue). Doesn't move the playhead. If the specified cue is playing, this command has no effect.
* **Preview:** Preview the selected cue without moving the Playhead.
* **Show Mode** Enable for Show Mode, Disable for Edit Mode.
* **Audition Window** Show or Hide the Audition Window.
* **Increase Prewait:** Increases the prewait time by given time for the selected cue.
* **Decrease Prewait:** Decreases the prewait time by given time for the selected cue.
* **Increase postwait:** Increases the postwait time by given time for the selected cue.
* **Decrease postwait:** Decreases the postwait time by given time for the selected cue.
* **Increase duration:** Increases the duration time by given time for the selected cue.
* **Decrease duration:** Decreases the duration time by given time for the selected cue.
* **Set/Unset Arm:** Set / Unset the Arm property of the selected cue.
* **Set/Unset Autoload:** Set / Unset the Autoload property of the selected cue.
* **Set Continue Mode:** Sets the continue mode of the selected cue.
* **Set Cue Color:** Sets the color of the selected cue.

There are presets included for most of these actions.

## Variables available (TCP mode only)

To use the following, replace INSTANCENAME with the name of your module instance.

* **$(INSTANCENAME:q_ver)**: Version of QLab attached
* **$(INSTANCENAME:n_id)**: UniqueID of the current Playhead Cue
* **$(INSTANCENAME:n_name)**: Name of the current Playhead Cue or [none]
* **$(INSTANCENAME:n_num)**: Number of the current Playhead Cue
* **$(INSTANCENAME:n_stat)**: Playhead Cue Status: "✕" if broken, "⏽" if loaded, "⏵" if running, "⏸" if paused, otherwise "·"
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_id)**: UniqueID of the current Running Cue
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_name)**: Name of the current Running Cue or [none]
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_num)**: Number of the current Running Cue
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_stat)**: Running Cue Status: "✕" if broken, "⏽" if loaded, "⏵" if running, "⏸" if paused, otherwise "·"
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_hhmmss)**: Remaining time for Running Cue as "HH:MM:SS"
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_hh)**: Hours left for Running Cue
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_mm)**: Minutes left for Running Cue
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_ss)**: Seconds left for Running Cue
* **$(INSTANCENAME:r_left)**: Shortest display time left for Running Cue. Shows .1 increments if tenths option set.
* **$(INSTANCENAME:q_{num}_name)**: Name of the QLab cue number {num}. See below for certain restrictions.


## Feedback available (TCP mode only)

* **Playhead Cue Color as Background**: Sets the button backgound to QLab color of the current playhead cue
* **Running Cue Color as Background**: Sets the button background to QLab color of the currently running cue
* **Colors for Workspace Mode**: Set the button color for QLab workspace modes: Audition (window on), Show Mode, Edit Mode


## OSC
This module connects to QLab on port 53000.

From Qlab preferences OSC controls tab make sure you have the "Use OSC controls" checkbox ticked.

### Running cue examples
 QLab can run many cues at the same time while Stream Deck has a limited number of buttons visible at once. So which *one* cue is the most useful to show on a button? This module looks for the most recently run (GO) cue and favors *run all at once* Group cues over other types of cues.

- Using a video show... 5 slide cues overlap to build a final image. After 5 'GO's all 5 cues are 'Running' resulting in a 5 picture overlay. The last 'GO' cue in the sequence will be the 'Running' cue.
- Now add 2 more screens with more images. Each transition (1 image for each screen) is now placed in a *run all* Group cue for list management. After the 5 group cues are run, QLab will show 20 cues active, 5 slides for each screen plus the 5 group cues. The last 'GO' **Group** cue will be the 'Running' cue.
- If the last 'GO' Group cue is *enter then run each*, the most recent 'GO' cue in the group will be the 'Running' cue.

### Cue Numbers
QLab allows almost any characters in a Cue Number. Some characters don't play well with OSC or Companion. Using '$', '(', or ')' in your Cue Number won't work if you want to use the q_{cue}_name variable or the 'q_bg' feedback.
